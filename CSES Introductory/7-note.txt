for k>=4

type of cells------no of such cells------multiplying factor

i. 2 sides completely block-----4------k^2-3
ii. 1 side completely block and gap of 1 on another------8------k^2-4
iii. 1 side completely block------4*(k-4)------k^2-5
iv. Gap of 1 on 2 sides------4------k^2-5
v. gap of 1 on 1 side------4*(k-4)-----k^2-7
vi. no restrictions from any side------(k-4)^2------k^2-9

final ans= (sum of all 6 above)/2 (to remove duplicacy)
